# POWER-BI-PROJECT
This project involved analysis of a toy store's operations dataset, sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and store locations. Using Power BIâ€™s data transformation, DAX calculations, visualization tools, and KPI cards, I developed an interactive dashboard that highlights product performance, and customer preferences.
