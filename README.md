In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of a toy store's operations, utilizing a dataset that included sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and store locations. Using Power BI’s data transformation tools, DAX calculations, visualizations, and KPI cards, I developed an interactive dashboard that highlights crucial trends and actionable insights on sales, customer preferences, and product performance. This dashboard effectively translates raw data into a user-friendly format, empowering stakeholders to make informed business decisions.
